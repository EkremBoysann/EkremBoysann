# 💫 About Me:
Hello! My name is Ekrem. I am a college student interested in software development.
I am currently learning Python by my own efforts. I also enjoy contributing to open source projects and working with the community.
I am curious about new technologies and trends and constantly focus on experimenting myself. I would like to develop Python-related projects and share them with you in the near future.
